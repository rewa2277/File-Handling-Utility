This project is a Java-based File Handling Utility that demonstrates basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files using core Java I/O classes. It is designed to help beginners understand how Java interacts with the file system and how to handle files efficiently with proper exception handling. The application can be used in small real-world scenarios like log management, storing simple user data, and configuration file handling. The project was developed and tested using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the code editor.Overall, this project serves as a practical learning tool for mastering Java file I/O operations and building confidence in working with the file system. By experimenting with this utility, learners can strengthen their understanding of core Java concepts, improve their coding skills, and appreciate the importance of proper error handling and clean code practices. The project can be used for academic purposes, lab assignments, mini-projects, or as a starting point for more complex file-based applications.
